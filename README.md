# SemiStructuredEncoders
The repository contains code to train TVM-KA model which can handle  semi-structured object sequences. We extend the examples code from Huggingface transformer repository to train our TVM-KA model. The link to the codebase can be found [here](https://github.ibm.com/rmurthyv/SemiStructuredEncoders)
